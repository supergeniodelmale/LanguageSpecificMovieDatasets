# LanguageSpecificMovieDatasets

## Introduction
This repository contains language-specific datasets that provide information on the most popular movies from a given country available on TMDB as of May 2023. The data was collected by a Python script through the TMDB API, entries were then filtered to remove any film that had "overview", "release_date" and "vote_average" data missing. Some details such as "genre", "duration", etc. where omitted but they can be easily retrieved with TMDB API by use of movie_id parameter from the "id" column.
